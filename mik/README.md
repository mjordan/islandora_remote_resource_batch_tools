# Move to Islandora Kit post-write hook to prepare content for ingestion

The script included in this directory enables the Move to Islandora Kit (MIK) to prepare content suitable for batch loading using the Islandora Remote Resource Batch module. For each object harvested by MIK, it does three things:

1. renames the DC or MODS file generated by MIK to include the 'DC' or 'MODS' datastream ID as appropriate
1. renames the thumbnail file to include the 'TN' datastream ID
1. generates a .txt file containing the remote object's URL

Also in this directory is a sample MIK configuration file that can be used in conjuction with the script to harvest objects from another Islandora instance. Running MIK using the configuration file and the post-write hook script will prepare harvested content that is ready to batch ingest.

The Move to Islandora Kit toolchain that this configuration file and script work with is "[OAI PMH for Islandora repositories](https://github.com/MarcusBarnes/mik/wiki/Toolchain:-OAI-PMH-for-Islandora-repositories)". This toolchain harvests content from an Islandora instance for loading into another. Originally created as a training and testing toolchain, it is completely suitable for harvesting data for discovery purposes as endabled by the Islandora Remote Resource Solution Pack.

## Usage

1. Install the [Move to Islandora Kit](https://github.com/MarcusBarnes/mik).
1. Copy `remote_resource_oai.ini` into your MIK directory.
1. Copy `remote_resource.php` into MIK's `extras/scripts/postwritehooks` directory.
1. Adjust the settings (OAI-PMH configuration, file paths, etc.) in the .ini file as necessary.
1. Run MIK: `./mik -c remote_resource_oai.ini`. During testing, it is a good idea to limit the number of objects harvested by including the `-l` (limit) option, e.g., `./mik -c remote_resource_oai.ini -l 5`.

The resulting output will ready to ingest using the Islandora Remote Resource Batch module.
